# Rotapie, a responsive animated jQuery pie chart plugin.

> Rotapie is a flexible, responsive animated jQuery pie chart plugin based on the html5 canvas api. Unlike traditional pie charts it displays a single selected slice at the top of the chart. Users can select a different slice by clicking on it. The pie chart can also be controlled via its public API. Additional information can be displayed by using the callbacks.
